The Geom90008 Spatial Data Management course offered by the University of Melbourne provides a comprehensive understanding of managing and analyzing spatial data within spatial databases. Students learn about data modeling, querying and analyzing spatial data, efficient data access techniques, advances in data management, and practical implementation. The course emphasizes the unique properties of spatial data and covers topics such as spatial reference systems, vector geometries, topological analysis, network models, and raster data handling. Assignments and projects allow students to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. By the end of the course, students are equipped with the skills to work as spatial data managers and GIS analysts.
