Learn some advanced algorithms and data structures.

- Treap
- Admortized Analysis: Prepaid/Potential
- Quake Heap
- Splay Tree
- Perfect Hashing/Cuckoo Hashing
- Range Tree

- Min Cut/Max Flow
- Karger's algorithm: 找最小割, 找多次取最优, 随机地找两个节点合并, 直到只剩下两个节点
- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm: 最早的最大流算法, 重复地找增广路径, 直到找不到
- Edmonds-Karp algorithm: 用BFS找增广路径, complexity更低
- Hall's theorem: 一个二分图存在完美匹配当且仅当对于每一个子集, 子集的大小大于等于子集的邻居的大小

## Vocabs

- conservation node: 保守节点, a node that has the same flow in and out
- residual graph: 残余图, a graph that represents the remaining capacity of each edge
- augmenting path: 增广路径, a path from source to sink in the residual graph
- feasible flow: 可行流, a flow that satisfies the capacity constraints and conservation constraints

- perfect matching: 完美匹配, a matching that covers all the nodes
- bipartite graph: 二分图, a graph that can be divided into two sets such that all edges are between the two sets

- disjoint paths: 不相交路径, paths that do not share any nodes

- vertex cover: 顶点覆盖, a set of vertices that covers all the edges
- maximal matching: 最大匹配, a matching that cannot be extended by adding another edge

- cardinality 基数，集合中元素的数量
